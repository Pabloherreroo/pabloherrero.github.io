  description:  
    I developed an embedded sensor system powered by an e-bike battery for data collection during cycling.  
    The full setup was installed using Raspberry Pi and sensor interfaces, while I also designed (via CAD) and built (with 3D printing) the physical enclosure.  
    Later, I built a complete web application stack (PostgreSQL + FastAPI + React) to visualize sensor data and create informative maps and dashboards.  
    This job allowed me to complete both Bachelor theses with a combined hardware–software approach and outstanding results.
