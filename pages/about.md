# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I started my career by earning a BSc in Electronics Engineering, designing and testing circuit boards and embedded firmware. This hardware-first approach gives me a critical perspective on resource-constrained computing, which is essential for modern AI.

I am currently pursuing my MSc in AI, specializing in **Reinforcement Learning** and **MLOps** for real-time applications.
